=====

Karel programming language with [Scratch-like interface](http://scratch.mit.edu/).
This project is based on [DesignBlocksJS project](http://code.google.com/p/scriptblocks/) by Evelyn Eastmond (evelyn@media.mit.edu)

The DesignBlocksJS website code relies on a sample set of projects and users on a database stored in GoogleAppEngine.  To connect it to another set of users, you need to change which server this is connected to.  The server protocol is not currently documented.
